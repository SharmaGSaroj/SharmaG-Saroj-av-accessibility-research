00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.000
I found a love for me

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.400
Darling just dive right in

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.900
And follow my lead

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.000
Well I found a girl beautiful
and sweet

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:49.300
I never knew you were the
someone waiting for me

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.100
'Cause we were just kids
when we fell in love

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.000
Not knowing what it was

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:05.650
I will not give you up this time

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.900
But darling, just kiss me slow,
your heart is all I own

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.100
And in your eyes you're holding mine

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:31.100
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark
with you between my arms

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.200
Barefoot on the grass, listening
to our favorite song

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:45.300
When you said you looked a mess, I
whispered underneath my breath

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:53.300
But you heard it, darling,
you look perfect tonight

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.600
Well I found a woman, stronger
than anyone I know

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.700
She shares my dreams, I hope that
someday I'll share her home

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:21.800
I found a love, to carry more
than just my secrets

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.100
To carry love, to carry
children of our own

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.700
We are still kids, but
we're so in love

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.500
Fighting against all odds

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:44.100
I know we'll be alright this time

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.600
Darling, just hold my hand

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.600
Be my girl, I'll be your man

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.100
I see my future in your eyes

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:09.600
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark,
with you between my arms

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.700
Barefoot on the grass, listening
to our favorite song

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.700
When I saw you in that dress,
looking so beautiful

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:31.400
I don't deserve this, darling,
you look perfect tonight

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:55.000
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark,
with you between my arms

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:02.000
Barefoot on the grass, listening
to our favorite song

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.400
I have faith in what I see

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.800
Now I know I have met
an angel in person

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.700
And she looks perfect

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.700
I don't deserve this

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.300
You look perfect tonight
